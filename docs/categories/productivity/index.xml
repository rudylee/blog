      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Trello as my primary task managers for the past couple of years. Recently, I found a very useful feature in Trello that helps me automating the creation of repetitive tasks.

At the moment, I am using this feature to create a few daily tasks that I want to do first in the morning such as meditation, coding exercise and learning chinese.</description>
