      <description>Today, I have to copy files from one S3 bucket to another S3 bucket which sitting in separate AWS account.
Initially, I was thinking to use S3 clients ( Tranmit or Cyberduck ) to download the files first and manually upload the files again to the other S3 Bucket. However, this approach will consume a lot of bandwidth and really slow if you have a lot of files in your S3 bucket.</description>
