      <description>Two weeks ago I decided to migrate my blog from Octopress to Hugo. I have been using Octopress as my blog engine since 2013 and I don&amp;rsquo;t have any problems with it. I can easily generate my blog as a static site with Octopress and host it on Github. It is a lot better setup than using Wordpress which requires database and PHP server. However, Octopress is not actively developed anymore and this is one of the reasons why I decided to migrate my blog to Hugo.</description>
