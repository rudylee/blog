      <description>Last week I found video tutorial to cook curry noodle in YouTube and decided to give it a try. Before, I cooked different type of curry (red and green curry ) and always made my own curry paste. The taste wasn&amp;rsquo;t bad but obviously something missing and I don&amp;rsquo;t know what it is.
This weekend I am gonna do something different by using pre-made curry paste. After researching a little bit, I found people recommend to use Mae Ploy Curry Paste which they say is used in some of Thai restaurants in Australia.</description>
