      <description>I spent some time last weekend to run through the new AngularJS course by Code School. This course is sponsored by Google which means you don&amp;rsquo;t need to pay for the Code School membership to play this course. AngularJS is one of the popular Javascript frameworks to build single page app application. You might be familiar with other frameworks such as Ember.js, Backbone.js and Knockout.js.
I really enjoyed the course and definitely learned something new from it.</description>
