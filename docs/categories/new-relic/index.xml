      <description>Background In this blog post, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how to set up an alert to monitor your sidekiq jobs using New Relic Query Language and New Relic Alert.
I was given a task to find a solution to monitor our sidekiq jobs. In the past, I used New Relic Sidekiq Plugin ( https://newrelic.com/plugins/secondimpression/131 ) to do this.
The plugin is a Ruby app that connects to your Redis instance, retrieves all of the sidekiq metrics such as jobs, queues and send it to New Relic using the agent library.</description>
