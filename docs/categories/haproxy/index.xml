      <description>We are using in one of our applications Cloudinary to host and resize images on the fly. We are also using Cloudflare for our CDN and DNS management.
I was given a task to setup a CNAME subdomain in CloudFlare to forward the request to Cloudinary. This way we can still have the benefit of serving static images from CDN as well as reducing the Cloudinary bandwidth usage.
My solution is to set HAProxy as a reverse proxy which responsible to fetch images from Cloudinary server.</description>
