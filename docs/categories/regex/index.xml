      <description>Last weekend, one our apps that is hosted on Heroku were reporting a lot of R14 errors.
R14 is an error that thrown by Heroku if the machine is running out of memory.
I quickly jumped into (logentries)[https://logentries.com/] to download the log file and opened it in Sublime Text.
However, I was having problem finding the request that is causing the problem because we also have our background job workers reporting R14 errors.</description>
