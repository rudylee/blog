    <p>It&rsquo;s already the end of January and I haven&rsquo;t posted anything yet this month. Thus I have to write something today after postponing it for days. For the last few weeks I was trying to adapt with new atmosphere. The feel is almost the same when I was moving to Jakarta from Pekanbaru, because basically moving to another place mean that you have to leave your comfort zone to another war zone.</p>

<p>When moved to Jakarta, I was a spoiled child, I was so scared because I have to take care all by myself. Still this time it&rsquo;s different. I have lived in Jakarta for 5 years, far away from my family, taking care almost all the things by myself and have a girlfriend ? All of that, unconsciously, has helped me in adapting with lifestyle at here.</p>

<p>So what I have done for the last few weeks ? about 3 weeks ago I went to Sydney Opera House. The scenery is quite good because it&rsquo;s located near coast. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rudylee/sets/72157625702888659/">Here are some photos that I took.</a></p>

<p>I am also went to my first meetup, <a href="http://sydjs.com/">Sydney Javascript</a>. At first, I didn&rsquo;t want to go but the place is very close to my apartment so I decided to give it a try. When arrived there, I feel a little bit awkward. Not just because that was my first meetup but as far as I could see, I am the only ASIAN in there. Fortunately, in the end I met 3 asian people, one from Philippines, one from China and the other one I forgot to ask :P</p>

<p>Overall the meetup is very interesting. I got free pizza, free beers and also I realise that my english need improvements a lot. I don&rsquo;t know if that because of the beers but when people in the meetup started debating, I barely understand what they are talking about. I could hear some of the words, but to understand the overall meaning ? none.</p>

<p>And for the last, yesterday I went to Baltimore Park near Central Station to watch some Chinese New Years festival. In the festival, there are several stands from selling toys, foods, drinks, etc. Also there is a stage for performances like singing and dancing. If you are curious I&rsquo;ll upload the photos tomorrow and that&rsquo;s all for this month :D</p>
